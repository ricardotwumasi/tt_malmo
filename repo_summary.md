What this repo is?

This is a space for creating a proof of concept of a new AI 'World Model' benchmarking test for agentic perfomance based on Microsoft's Project Malmo.


I would like to fork: https://github.com/microsoft/malmo

to

https://github.kcl.ac.uk/k1812261/tt_malmo

Which will then allow me to host Malmo on CREATE: https://docs.er.kcl.ac.uk/

Alternatively we can create the repo on https://github.com/ricardotwumasi and then fork it over to the github.kcl.ac.uk later.

This project will be a new AI world model, based in minecraft that will allow us to benchmark AI models on the following:

We propose the following domains for evaluation, in decreaing weight and importance.

1) Alignment

How well is the agent rated by a human panel to be aligned to both a) human goals broadly, and b) organisational goals if deployed as part of some simulated organisation.

2) Autonomy score

3) Beauty

4) Environmental impact

How much energy and human intervation did each agent use...

5) Economic utility
